this repository is for having a fast fresh install of fedora asahi remix
this repo and every dot file is made with personal preference of me

you have to download firefox-*.tar.gz and replace /usr/lib64/ with

sudo cp -r source /usr/lib64/

this will fix camera and mic problem 
it will not fix widevine. widevine is not supported on arm platform

hyprland dotfiles are made on top of typecraft dot files.
if you want you can get the dotfile from here:
https://github.com/typecraft-dev/dotfiles
